# Vivaldi Modding

## What

This repository is a collection of mods I have written for the [**Vivaldi web browser**](https://vivaldi.com). Each file is a standalone modification which works on its own, but you might as well bring them together: One `user.css` and one `user.js` file is generally all you need. Every mod contains a link to the Vivaldi forum topic it was first featured in, however the most up to date versions can be found on this github repo. I cannot guarantee that all of these mods function as advertised at this point in time, since the Vivaldi user interface is an ever changing target, but below is a list of actively maintained mods. I do use these myself at the moment, so should you run into problems with any of them, please let me know by creating an issue, or by posting in the according topic on Vivaldi Forum.

## Actively maintained mods

* `addressbar-theming.css`
* `backup-search-engines.js`
* `changing-buttons.css`
* `history-clock.js`
* `import-export_themes.js`
* `profile-image.js`
* `status-bar-dropdown.js`
* `tab-scroll.js`

## How to

Vivaldi's user interface is based on web technologies, therefore it's relatively easy to customize its appearance and functionality with CSS and Javascript. Detailed explanations on how to implement these modifications can be found in the [**Official Guide**](https://forum.vivaldi.net/topic/10549/modding-vivaldi/40). The [**Modding Forum Board**](https://forum.vivaldi.net/category/52/modifications) is a great resource, featuring guides on how to automate the process of patching your installation after updating the browser and providing you with a plethora of mods written by the community.
