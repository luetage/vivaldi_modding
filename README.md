# Vivaldi Modding

## What

This repository is a collection of mods I have written for the
[**Vivaldi web browser**][1]. Each file is a standalone modification which works
on its own, but you might as well bring them together: One `user.css` and one
`user.js` file is generally all you need. Every mod contains a link to the
Vivaldi forum topic it was first featured in, however the most up to date
versions can be found on this github repo. I cannot guarantee that all of these
mods function as advertised at this point in time, since the Vivaldi user
interface is an ever changing target, but below is a list of actively maintained
mods. I do use these myself at the moment, so should you run into problems with
any of them, please let me know by creating an issue, or by posting in the
according topic on Vivaldi Forum.

## How to

Vivaldi's user interface is based on web technologies, therefore it's relatively
easy to customize its appearance and functionality with CSS and Javascript.
Detailed explanations on how to implement these modifications can be found in
the [**Official Guide**][2]. The [**Modding Forum Board**][3] is a great
resource, featuring guides on how to automate the process of patching your
installation after updating the browser and providing you with a plethora of
mods written by the community.
