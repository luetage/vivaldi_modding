# Vivaldi Modding

## What

This repository is a collection of mods I have written for the
[**Vivaldi web browser**][1]. Each file is a standalone modification which works
on its own. Every mod contains a link to the Vivaldi forum topic it was first
featured in, however the most up to date versions can be found in this github
repo. I cannot guarantee that all of these mods function as advertised at this
point in time, since the Vivaldi user interface is an ever changing target, but
below is a list of actively maintained mods. I do use these myself at the
moment, so should you run into problems with any of them, please let me know by
creating an issue, or by posting in the according topic on Vivaldi Forum.

## How to

Vivaldi’s user interface is based on web technologies, therefore it’s relatively
easy to customize its appearance and functionality with CSS and Javascript.
Detailed explanations on how to implement these modifications can be found in
the [**Official Guide**][2]. The [**Modding Forum Board**][3] is a great
resource, featuring guides on how to automate the process of patching your
installation after updating the browser and providing you with a plethora of
mods written by the community.
